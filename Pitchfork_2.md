## Pitchfork Analysis Part 2

(continued...)

The second analysis (below) provides a deeper dive into the distribution of the best new music award by adding genre as a classification, year over year. The top panel of plot two shows the distribution of awards by genre for all artists for the period 2000 thru 20016, while the bottom three panels show the same distribution for each of the three artist classes. Itâ€™s clear that Rock genre is the dominant recipient of the best new music award, but the awards given by artist class is skewed. While Established and Semi-Established artists received a majority of the awards in thru the year 2010, the number of awards given after dropped off significantly, with New artists receiving a significant majority of the awards in not only Rock, but also Pop/R&B, Experimental and Rap.

Proposed Formal Analysis:

While there appears to be a bias on some level, a deeper dive into the content of the actual reviews is required to examine some of the factors which are positively correlated with a positive review and a best new music award. Python can be leveraged to identify key words and phrases which could be positively correlated with a positive review. From the analysis of the text, a prediction model and classification model could be built to identify which factors are most significant to the review score and receipt of best new music award.
